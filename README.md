# technify

Check out [Technica](https://gotechnica.org), an all-ladies hackathon. They've been making these sweet profile pictures and I thought I'd make a quick script that automates the process.

Here's a [demo](http://technify.herokuapp.com)

An example of what I got from putting my Facebook profile picture through it.

## Setup
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the app
```
python app.py
```
Runs on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) by default.
